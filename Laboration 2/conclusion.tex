After testing the Triangle.java class the following was concluded:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The class is poorly implemented with a lot of bugs.
	\item Many errors would be fixed if the isImpossible() method was implemented correctly, i.e. checking for realistic proportions etcetera.
	\item It would also be advisable to not only check that the input is an Integer but also that it is a positive Integer.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Furthermore, it is very difficult to estimate Boundary values and Equivalence Class Partitions when the input is a set of numbers rather than a number interval.
