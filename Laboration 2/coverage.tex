During the lab three different code coverage criteria were used to evaluate to which extent the code was tested; Statement coverage, Decision/branch coverage and Condition coverage. 

Statement coverage refers to how many of the statements of a tested unit that are executed at least once. The degree of Decision/branch coverage means how many of the branches of an unit, i.e. true or false, that are executed at least once by the tests. Actually, the decision coverage only specifies how many of the decisions have been evaluated to both true and false, whereas the branch coverage shows if all branches, e.g. both if and else in an if-clause, have been executed.
