First of all, it is impossible to tell that you have found all defects in an inspected object. Here, an estimation of quite enough defects would be an accurate estimation. 

\subsection{Subjective method}
It is difficult to prove the accuracy of a subjective method, since it is basically a guess. However, an experienced tester could intuitively get a feeling of what should be "good enough" and thus make it an accurate method. 
This will of course highly depend on the experience of the inspector as well as his knowledge in similar projects.

\subsection{Capture-recapture method}
It is to some extent possible to prove the accuracy of these method since they are based on mathematical models. These models can even take into account that different defects are harder to find as well as the different detection capabilities amongst the inspectors. The drawback of these models are, however, that they don't take into account the complexity of the project being inspected. That is, if two inspectors found defects according to, lets say, matrix $M_{1}$ described in section~\ref{inspection}, the capture-recapture method would give the same point estimation of the amount of defects whether it was a NextDate-program or a NASA-satelite.
