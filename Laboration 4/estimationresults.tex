Below follows the results of the failure estimation as well as the estimation method used.

\subsection{TROPICO R-1500}
TROPICO R-1500 is a Brazilian Electronic Switching System with 1500 subscribers and a file, godata1.txt containing the failure count of said system, will be analyzed. A compliation of the results are found in Table~\ref{goelokumototable} below.
\subsubsection*{Subjective Estimation} 
First the cumulative sum of the faults found in week 1 to week 50 were plotted, see Figure~\ref{cumulativegodata1} below, to see if a failure over time trend could be found.
The inspectors identified an exponentially declining trend and estimated the two variables $N_{future}$ and $N_{tot}$ to be 500 and 600 faults respectively, see Table~\ref{goelokumototable}. 
\subsubsection*{Goel-Okumoto method}
To use the Goel-Okumoto method, described in section~\ref{methods}, a program, go.m, were used to calculate the variables $a=547.5$ and $b=0.0242$.
When estimating the $N_{future}$ variable the found values of $a$ and $b$ were inserted in the Goele-Okumoto formula and $t$ were increased to 75, since $N_{future}$ is the cumulative sum of the errors found in additionally 50\% time. 
$N_{tot} = a$ since it is the sum of all errors found in an infinite amounut of time.
The estimation of $N_{future}$ and $N_{tot}$ was 458.1 and 547.5 respecitvely, see Table~\ref{goelokumototable}.
\subsubsection*{Real Data}
To find the accuracy of the subjective estimation and the Goel-Okumoto method the real values of $N_{future}$ and $N_{tot}$ were found by using a file, godata2.txt, containing the failure count of 31 more weeks. 
The real value of $N_{future}$ is the sum of all errors up to weak 75, which gives $N_{future}=459$, but $N_{tot}$ cannot be verified since there is no, nor will it ever be, a file containing the errors found until infinity. However, the last value of godata2.txt is 461 and is found at week 81, compared to 468 at week 81 in the Goel-Okumoto estimation.
