When estimating the total amount of defects, capture-recapture methods can be a valuable tool and often more accurate than subjective methods. However, it wouldn't hurt to first use a subjective method for guessing, and then use a capture-recapture method and see if they are similar, If there is a distinct difference between the two estimations, one should reconsider the accuracy of the said estimations.

In a real software development project these estimation results can be used as guidelines to how much effort should be spent on defect detection as well as to tell when the defect detection is ``complete''.
