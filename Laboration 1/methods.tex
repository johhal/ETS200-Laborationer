The goal of this laboration excersice was to test some common methods and techniques appropriate for Black-Box Testing.
According to "`Practical Software Testing"' there are five common methods:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Equivalence class partitioning
	\item Boundary value analysis
	\item State transition testing
	\item Cause and effect graphing
	\item Error guessing
\end{itemize}

However, during the laboration only Equivalence class partitioning and Boundary value analysis where tested hence only they will be discussed further.
