After testing the Triangle.java class the following was concluded:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is a poorly implemented class with a lot of bugs.
	\item Many errors would be fixed if the isImpossible() method was implemented correctly, i.e. checking for realistic proportions etcetera.
	\item It would also be adviseable to not only check that the input is an integer but also that it is a positive integer.
\end{itemize}

Further, it is very difficult to estimate Boundary values and Equivalence class partitions when the input is a set of numbers rather then one number in intervalls.
