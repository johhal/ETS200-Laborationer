When estimating the total amount of defects capture-recapture methods can be a valuable tool and often more accurate then subjective methods. However, it wouldn't hurt to first guess (subjective method) and then use a capture-recapture method and see if they are similar, else you should reconsider the accuracy of said estimations.

In a real software development project these estimation results can be used as guidelines of how much effort should be spent on defect detection as well as to tell when the defect detection is "`completed"'
